We count how many times each letter appears in the licensePlate (ignoring numbers, spaces, and case).
Then, for each word in the list, we check if it has all those letters in equal or higher quantity.
If it does, it is a “completing word.”
Among all completing words, we choose the shortest one.
If multiple words have the same length, we return the one that appears first in the list.
