We first sort all card values so we know the increasing order.
Then, we use a queue to simulate the revealing process.
We repeatedly take the front position from the queue and place the next smallest card there.
After placing one card, we move the next position in the queue to the back (like rotating the deck).
This way, we find the order in which the cards must be arranged initially so that they are revealed in increasing order.
